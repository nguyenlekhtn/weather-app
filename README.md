# weather-app

My weather app based on the requirement of PROJECT: WEATHER APP on TheOdinProject https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app. The app is the results from what I learned on promises, async/await and using APIs topic.

This project uses OpenWeather API to fetch weather datas and displays it on my app.

Feature of this weather app:
*Able to search for a specific city
*Toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
